##### KFC
Times change but values don’t. And just like the Colonel, we know that nothing beats the value of hard work. It’s what goes into every **good old fashioned meal** we make. It’s also why, after more than 90 years, folks all over the world keep coming back for more.There are now over **24,000** KFC outlets in more than 145 countries and territories around the world.
